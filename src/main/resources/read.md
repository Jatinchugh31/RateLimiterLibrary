Awesome, let’s build a **Rate Limiter System** that meets **100% of the staff engineer criteria** in your evaluation grid! Here's a structured plan to meet all criteria and highlight advanced design considerations.

---

### 🎯 **System Requirements (Recap)**

✅ **Multiple rate limiting algorithms**
✅ **Thread-safe implementation**
✅ **Support per-user and per-API limits**
✅ **Configurable time windows and request limits**
✅ **Return appropriate responses when limits are exceeded**

---

### 🌟 **High-Level Design**

Here’s a **modular, pluggable, and highly concurrent architecture**:

#### 1️⃣ Core Components

* **RateLimiterManager**: Entry point to manage different limiters.
* **RateLimiter** (Interface): Different algorithms implement this (Fixed Window, Sliding Window, Token Bucket).
* **LimiterKey**: A unique key for user-API pairing.
* **LimiterState**: Tracks counters, timestamps, or tokens per limiter.
* **LimiterStore**: Backend store (in-memory/Redis) for state persistence.
* **Plugin architecture**: Support adding/removing new algorithms.

---

#### 2️⃣ Algorithms (Advanced Implementations)

* **Fixed Window**: Simple counter reset at each interval.
* **Sliding Window**: Sliding window log, approximate counter with time-based decays.
* **Token Bucket**: Refill tokens at a rate, consume on requests.

Each algorithm should:

* Support **multiple scheduling strategies** (e.g., burst handling, soft limits).
* Be **configurable per API/user**.
* Be tested with **circuit breakers** or **bulkhead patterns** to isolate failures.

---

#### 3️⃣ Concurrency (Advanced)

✅ Use **`CompletableFuture`** and **Fork-Join** for parallel checks and updates.
✅ **Lock-free algorithms** (e.g., **AtomicLong, CAS** for counters) to avoid contention.
✅ If using **Redis** (or another store), use **Lua scripts** to ensure atomic updates across distributed systems.

---

#### 4️⃣ Error Handling & Resilience

✅ **Circuit Breakers**: If a store becomes slow or fails, fallback to local cache with approximate limits.
✅ **Retries with backoff** for transient store errors.
✅ **Graceful degradation**: Don’t hard-fail; fallback to default limits or allow partial traffic.

---

#### 5️⃣ Design Patterns

✅ **Strategy Pattern**: RateLimiter implementations.
✅ **Factory Pattern**: RateLimiterManager dynamically picks limiter based on config.
✅ **Plugin architecture**: New limiters as plugins.
✅ **Decorator pattern**: Wrap limiters with metrics, circuit breakers.

---

#### 6️⃣ Testing Strategy

✅ Unit tests per limiter (cover algorithm edge cases).
✅ Integration tests: Concurrency tests, fallback scenarios.
✅ Load tests: Validate performance under concurrent traffic.

### 🏗️ **Detailed Component Sketch**

```java
interface RateLimiter {
    boolean allowRequest(LimiterKey key, int weight);
}

class FixedWindowRateLimiter implements RateLimiter { ... }
class SlidingWindowRateLimiter implements RateLimiter { ... }
class TokenBucketRateLimiter implements RateLimiter { ... }

class RateLimiterManager {
    private final Map<String, RateLimiter> algorithmRegistry;
    private final LimiterStore store;

    public boolean isRequestAllowed(String user, String api, String algorithm, int weight) {
        RateLimiter limiter = algorithmRegistry.get(algorithm);
        LimiterKey key = new LimiterKey(user, api);
        return limiter.allowRequest(key, weight);
    }
}
```

### 💪 **Key Features to Highlight in Your Interview**

✅ **Advanced concurrency**: Non-blocking updates, thread-safe shared structures.
✅ **Optimized algorithms**: Efficient time-based eviction (e.g., TimeWheel for Sliding Window).
✅ **Circuit breakers & retries**: Robust fallback and error handling.
✅ **Plugin architecture**: Future-proof for new algorithms.
✅ **Comprehensive testing**: Unit, integration, concurrency, and load testing.
